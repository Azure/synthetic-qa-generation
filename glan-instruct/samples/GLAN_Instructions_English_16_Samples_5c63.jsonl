What steps would you take to resolve the conflict using Git?**\n\n   A merge conflict might occur when two branches have changes in the same part of a file. For example, if both `feature-login` and `feature-signup` branches modify the same line in `app.js`, a conflict will arise when attempting to merge these branches.\n\n   Steps to resolve the conflict:\n   - Identify the conflict: Git will mark the conflict in the file with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.\n   - Edit the file to resolve the conflict: Manually choose which changes to keep or combine them.\n   - Mark the conflict as resolved: After editing, use `git add <filename>` to mark the file as resolved.\n   - Commit the resolution: Use `git commit` to commit the resolved changes.\n   - Continue with the merge: If the conflict was during a merge, complete the merge process.\n\n3. **Your team follows a workflow where new features are developed"}

Accuracy alone can be misleading, especially in imbalanced datasets where one class may dominate. Precision and recall offer insights into the model's performance in identifying true positives and minimizing false positives and false negatives, respectively. The F1-score balances precision and recall, providing a single metric that accounts for both. This holistic approach ensures that the model is not only accurate but also reliable and effective in real-world applications."}
